The code models a game reminiscent of Pokémon, featuring creatures called Profemon with unique names, specialties, and skills. Profemon can level up and learn skills based on their specialty.

It defines a Trainer class to manage a team of up to three Profemon and a collection of additional Profemon. Trainers can add, remove, and select active Profemon from their team.

The code introduces department classes (ML, SOFTWARE, HARDWARE) that specialize in different Profemon specialties. These departments filter and store Profemon of the correct specialty.

The goal is to create an interactive game where trainers collect, train, and battle with Profemon, akin to the gameplay style of Pokémon, with an added layer of specialization through the department classes.
