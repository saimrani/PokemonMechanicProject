            @brief      Increase the Profémon's level based on
                        the given 'exp'. The Profémon will level
                        up if it reaches the required experience.
                        Depending on the Profémon's specialty,
                        the required experience goes up by a certain
                        amount everytime the Profémon levels up.
                        'ML' required experience goes up by 10,
                        'SOFTWARE' goes up by 15, and 'HARDWARE'
                        goes up by 20. Make sure to update the
                        required, current experience and level
                        private data members accordingly. The given
                        'exp' can result in the Profémon leveling                             up multiple times

          For example   :   starting at lvl 0, calling 'levelUp(115)'
                            on different types of Profémon would result
                            in the following:

                            ML:
                              - new level: 2
                              - current exp: 5
                              - required exp: 70

                            SOFTWARE:
                              - new level: 2
                              - current exp: 0
                              - required exp: 80

                            HARDWARE:
                              - new level: 1
                              - current exp: 65
                              - required exp: 70

                            As stated above, each specialty has
                            a different speed of leveling up

            (SkillNameSlot1) [(Uses)] : (description of skill in slot 1)
            (SkillNameSlot2) [(Uses)] : (description of skill in slot 2)

        For example:
        Maryash [SOFTWARE] | lvl 2 | exp 30/80 | hp 13500
